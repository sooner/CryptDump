% Security plays a vital role when people deploy services in the cloud,so encryption is ofthen used. Computing over encrypted data has prove useful in such situation. Cryptdb\citep{popa2011cryptdb} is such kind of system. To support more operation on encrypted data, Cryptdb uses the multi-onion design, which produce significant storage overhead when we need to backup the data. Traditional data deduplication technique do not work well on encrypted data. In this paper, we1 present the chanllenges we meet when we need to backup data using popular data backup tools, and we propose a new backup method with the help of metadata and implement a new tool Cryptdump for cryptedb. Experiments show that our method can  significantly reduce the storage size with little overhead. Our deduplication method can also be used together with traditional data deduplication methods to further reduce the storage size.
